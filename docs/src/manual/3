and exposing explicit control on the trade-off between scalability and
fidelity. It is based on the XEN-hypervisor.

    *Time dilation* functionality scales guestsâ€™ view of physical resources
    helping to accurately model complex net- works.

    *Reproducibilty* through a pythonic experiment description API, 
    which automates deployment and execution, and support for any paravirtualized (PV) guest, requires zero modifica-
    tions and provides full POSIX compatibility. Real-world appli-
    cations and network stacks can be directly tested on our platform.
